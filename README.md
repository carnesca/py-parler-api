Parler.com requires both a CAPTCHA solution and an SMS verification code every time a user logs in. Therefore, you will need to first log into the platform in your browser, go through the CAPTCHA and SMS verifcation and use Inspect > Network > Headers > Request Headers to retrieve the cookie that was created in order to make requests with this repo. You'll want to copy the entire cookie:
